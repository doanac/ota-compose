## Why not the docker-compose that comes with the Notary project?

The Notary server's key is only good for a host named "notary-server"
that's binding to 127.0.0.1. This makes it hard to run inside
docker-compose and have the service accessible to test devices on
your network.

The keys included were generated by running `./generate-keys.sh`. These
are **less** secure in a way, but are really the only way to test on a
home network without doing SSL port forwarding.

## Moving to Production

TODO - how to get SSL keys done right
TODO - notary token auth setup, should we include faux-auth2 with this?

## Usage

One time initalization:
~~~
$ notary -d /tmp/notary-trust --tlscacert ./fixtures/root-ca.crt -s https://tuftree-notary:4443 init hub.foundries.io/lmp
~~~

## Add an "update"
~~~
# NOTE: This must be *canonical json* (ie keys must be in alphabetical order)
cat >/tmp/custom.json <<EOF
